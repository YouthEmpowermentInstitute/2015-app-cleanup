					<p>There are many different reason why workers are paid low wages.Because so many fieldworkers migrate from poor countries, employers can get away with paying them with a very low wage compared to native-born Americans.They can often discriminated because of how thy look, what they dress like, and what they believe in.</p>

					<h3>Yes!</h3>
					<p>Many fieldworkers in the Watsonville area work on a seasonal basis. Every year, they begin working in April and end around November. Because of this temporary basis, hardly any workers receive benefits or raises. There are hundreds of workers who have been working in the fields for twenty-years, but have never received a raise (except for when the federal minimum wage raises). Workers should be getting paid at lest minimum wage, but some don't even get paid that.</p>

					<h3> What are they? </h3>
					<p><strong>Child Labor</strong>: Due to low wages, field workers are unable to provide for their families. As a result, many parents unwillingly put their children to work in the fields beside them.  	<br></br><strong>Homelessness</strong>: Due to low wages, field workers don't have enough money to buy a house in expensive areas like Santa Cruz County. This means that they can either rent rooms or live on the streets. 					Not only are wages unfair for the amount of labor fieldworkers do, they are not <em>a living wage</em>.</p>

				<h3>How is it that other workers in  other jobs have safety benefits but field workers don't? </h3>
	
				<p>	Field workers must pack as much produce as they can in order to make a certain amount of money. 				These workers don't have sick leave, meaning if they take a sick day off they will not make any money. 				Many of these field workers can not afford to lose a day worths of money so they decide to go to work instead. 				The produce in the fields and other co-workers are at risk of getting infected by the sick worker. 				If the person who is sick attends work, it is possible for the worker to infect the produce they are picking and the people they are working around. 				This worker can be endangered of getting more sick--leading to a disease or something worse.<br></br> 
				Additionally, field workers are also at risk because of pesticides. Pesticides are meant for attracting , then destroying pest. 				Pesticides contain many poisonous chemicals that can lead to cancer or male fertility if the body is exposed to it. 				Pesticides can also be passed down from a mother to a baby if the body was exposed to pesticides.</p>

		<h2> Catcalling </h2>

	<div data-role="content">
		<p> <strong> Verbal Abuse </strong></p>
		<p>Working in the fields is very difficult, especially for women. Most female fieldworkers experience some sort of sexual harassment while working in the fields. Sexual harassment often occurs because farm workers rarely,if ever, receive sexual harassment training. A common form of sexual harassment is catcalling. Catcalling is when a women receives an unwanted comment, whistle, or shout of a sexual nature.</p>

		 <p> <strong>Sexual Abuse </strong></p>
		 <p> Imagine going to work and dealing with nasty men who keep touching and looking at you you inappropriately, as if they are mentally undressing you with their eyes. Women in the fields suffer these types of harassment all the time. Statistics have shown 80% of women field workers report sexual harassment and 20% percent don't report it.</p>

		<h2> Injuries </h2>

	<div data-role="content">
		<p> <strong> Injuries</strong> </p>
		<p>Many field workers in California and around the nation are undocumented immigrants, so when they do injure themselves at work they are sometimes too afraid to confront their supervisor. Having an injury can mean that they'll get fired and become unable to provide for their families, or worse, get deported. When field workers do get injured and they file for workers compensation, they most likely don't get it. A common injury field workers face are back pains. The back pain could be hurting them so badly that they need to see a doctor. It's unfair how field workers can tolerate all that pain, while most people can even tolerate a simple pinch.</p>

		<div data-role="popup" id="processing_answer">
		<p>In the processing industry many workers work hard in a cold cooler/freezer for long hours causing stress. Working in a cooler can lead to an illness because of the warm sweat that is being produced while being in a very cold area. This can take money away from people who work in the food processing because they get ill and have to stop working. It can also affect co-workers because the illness can spread if the ill worker decided to go to work while being sick. Additionally, these workers have to deal with heavy machines that can possibly injure or hurt a worker. Some examples of these cases can be when a person accidentally  cuts a hand or a finger. Another example is when a worker injures a knee or a back. Many of these people are left injured or scared because of the poor working conditions. This work brings stress among the people who work in the processing industry.</p>
